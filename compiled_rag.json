        "question": "What is the fine for engaging hyperdrive near a space station?",
        "reasoning": "The context specifies that Class-4 starships must disengage hyperdrive within 50,000 km of a major space station to avoid gravimetric shearing. It also states that violations incur a 50-credit fine. The question asks about the fine for engaging hyperdrive near a space station, which is directly addressed in the rule. Since engaging hyperdrive within that range is a violation, the fine applies.",
        "reasoning_and_answer": "The fine for engaging hyperdrive within 50,000 km of a major space station is 500 credits. This is because the rule states that all Class-4 starships must disengage hyperdrive within that range to prevent gravimetric shearing, and any violation incurs a 500-credit fine.",

        "question": "Do aliens get extra vacation time?",
        "reasoning": "The context states that crew members of alien descent (Non-Terran) are granted an additional 4 cycles of solar rest per standard orbit, which is equivalent to extra rest time. The term \"solar rest\" is interpreted as vacation or rest time. Therefore, aliens are granted extra rest time under the specified conditions.",
        "reasoning_and_answer": "Yes, aliens are granted extra vacation time—specifically, an additional 4 cycles of solar rest per standard orbit—provided they submit form X-99 to the bio-medical bay.",

        "question": "Can I fire the plasma weapon at a small fighter?",
        "reasoning": "The context specifies that the primary plasma weapon may only be fired under three conditions: shields below 20%, a captain-issued Code Red, and the target being a confirmed hostile dreadnought. A small fighter does not meet the condition of being a \"confirmed hostile dreadnought,\" so the weapon cannot be fired at a small fighter based on the provided rules.",
